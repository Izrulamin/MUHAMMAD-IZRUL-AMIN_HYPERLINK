<p style = " color : magenta ; " > Get Organized. Making a plan for what you're going to do and when you're going to do it will make sure you're always ahead of the curve - literally.</p>



<p style = " color : blue ; " > Divide it up. Studying isn't fun to begin with, and forcing yourself through a study marathon will only make it worse. Dividing your work into manageable chunks and rewarding yourself when you finish each chunk will make studying (more) fun.</p>

<p style = " color : red ; " >Sleep. Don't underestimate the importance of those eight hours of zzz's every night! Getting a good night's rest will sharpen your focus and improve your working memory.</p>
